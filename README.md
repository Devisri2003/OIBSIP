TASK-1[IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION]:   
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.

TASK-2[UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON]:        
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project


TASK-3[CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING]:        
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn
how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.


TASK-4[EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING]:      
We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get
started!

From this visualization, you can notice something interesting about the spam email. A lot of them are having high number of “spammy” words such as: free, money, product etc. Having this awareness might help us to make better decision when it comes to designing the spam detection system.
One important thing to note is that word cloud only displays the frequency of the words, not necessarily the importance of the words. Hence it is necessary to do some data cleaning such as removing stopwords, punctuation and so on from the data before visualizing it.


TASK-5[SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON]:       
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So let’s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
